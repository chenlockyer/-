Sentiment and Classification and Stance detection is a critical task in natural language processing, widely applied in sentiment classification, public opinion analysis, and social issue research. To address the limitations of traditional methods in multi-turn dialogues and complex text classification, this paper proposes an improved prompt engineering strategy based on the ERNIE large model. By optimizing input prompt templates, the proposed method enhances the accuracy and robustness of stance classification tasks. Multiple real-world datasets were used as research subjects to construct a complete workflow from text input to model output. This workflow includes post-processing of model-generated results, automatic stance detection, and comparative experiments with manually labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed prompt engineering approach achieves high accuracy in classifying positive and negative. This study provides an effective method for text classification and public opinion analysis based on large models, highlighting the critical impact of prompt design on model performance.
